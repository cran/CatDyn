\title{
Correlation Matrix to Covariance Matrix Conversion
}
\description{
Function to convert a correlation matrix to a covariance matrix.
}
\usage{
cor2cov(cor.mat, sd, discrepancy = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
  \item{cor.mat}{
The correlation matrix to be converted.
}
  \item{sd}{
A vector that contains the standard deviations of the variables in the correlation matrix.
}
  \item{discrepancy}{
A neighborhood of 1, such that numbers on the main diagonal of the correlation matrix will
be considered as equal to 1 if they fall in this neighborhood
}
}
\details{
This function was copied from package MBESS.

The correlation matrix to convert can be either symmetric or triangular. The covariance
matrix returned is always a symmetric matrix.
}
\note{
The correlation matrix input should be a square matrix, and the length of sd should be
equal to the number of variables in the correlation matrix (i.e., the number of rows/columns).
Sometimes the correlation matrix input may not have exactly 1s on the main diagonal, due to, eg,
rounding; discrepancy specifies the allowable discrepancy so that the function still considers
the input as a correlation matrix and can proceed (but the function does not change the numbers
on the main diagonal).
